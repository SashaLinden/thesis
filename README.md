# Thesis
This is a script to see how much time it takes for a Brane container to start up. It uses the brane profiler to get results on how long the creation takes.

### How to run
Currently the installed version of brane on my computer does not have a profiler. To fix this I compiled brane and put it in a bin/ folder. If a binary of brane with the profiler is available, change this in brane.py
